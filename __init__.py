#used to treat all the directories with this __ini__.py as a package
# The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat directories containing the file as packages. 
# This prevents directories with a common name, such as string , from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path

# here the directory is the src. src is a directory and inside src is the file named __init__.py
